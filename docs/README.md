## Circuit Summary

### Core Circuits
- **Deposit Circuit**: Public to shielded conversion with privacy binding (6 signals)
- **Transfer Circuit**: Shielded transfers with encrypted note delivery (9 signals)
- **Withdraw Circuit**: Shielded to public conversion with identity verification (5 signals)

### Components
- **Note Commitment**: Reusable component for note commitment computation (5 signals)
- **Nullifier**: Reusable component for nullifier generation (4 signals)

### Key Features
- **Wallet-Bound Identity**: Derived from wallet keys using Poseidon hash
- **Privacy by Default**: All transaction details are shielded
- **Encrypted Notes**: Recipient privacy through encrypted note delivery
- **Merkle Tree Verification**: 16-level Merkle tree for note inclusion proofs
- **Amount Conservation**: Mathematical constraints prevent value creation
